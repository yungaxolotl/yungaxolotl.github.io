This is a little project of mine. I have challenged myself to make a personal directory of which I can set to my homepage.
The homepage will have links to stuff I use often and also condense all the resources I will need for university.

Sorry if my code hurts your eyes and is inefficient, I have had ZERO coding experience and this site is my first attempt at using
HTML and CSS so I'm far out of my depth here lmao.
